This repository contains the latest versions of our models to predict Gamma-Ray Burst and Gravitational Wave event observation frequency. Filenames will change to make more sense later. For now, [test1.py](http://test1.py/) is our Gamma-Ray Burst model. Dependencies will be listed below.

## Gamma-Ray Burst Model ([test1.py](http://test1.py/)):

A model that predicts the number of Gamma-Ray Bursts we can observe for a given inclination angle and sensor sensitivity. A list of formulas for Luminosity for given angle Î¸ is in formulas.txt

Dependencies:

-   tkinter
-   from matplotlib.figure: Figure
-   matplotlib.pyplot
-   from matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg: FigureCanvasTkAgg, NavigationToolbar2Tk
-   numpy
